# movement-data
Using data from Google Maps API, I´m collecting data on movement of some cities in the world.

It took a while to get my note out of my children's hand, but I did this project with the hope of analyzing the movement of people in cities around the world.

Using Google Maps API, an instant map of a city is generated, with traffic information. In this image, pixel of the image of 4 types of colors is counted:
```
Green	 RGB (99,214,104)	- for low or none movement at all
Orange	 RGB (255,151.77)	- some movement
Red	 RGB (242,60,50)	- greate movement
Dark Red RGB (129,31,31)	- heavy movement
```
